# SmartOS Global Zone Cookbooks

These cookbooks make up a large chunk of the cookbooks that is used by
Kaizen Garden and previously on my personal SmartOS Compute Node.

It is assumed that you will install additional software and tools
(i.e. your raid controller management tools like MegaCli after
forking and submoduling in your hardware cookbook.)
